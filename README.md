# ACM x Robosub ROS Workshop (Part 1) 
Welcome to the ACM x Robosub ROS workshop! This repository contains all the differnet packages we'll be looking at/making. 

## What even is ROS? 
ROS stands for Robot Operating System. Is it an operating system? Not really. ROS is what's called a "middleware", meaning that it provides an interface for data transfer between different programs. It allows developers to more effectively compartmentalize different sections of their code that perform different tasks, which, if you're working with a robot that has many different sensors and actuators that performs complex tasks, is incredibly useful.
